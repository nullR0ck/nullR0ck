- 👋 Hi, I’m @nullR0ck
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity, Magic: The Gathering, Computer Science, Philosophy, and much more!
- 🌱 I’m always learning new and exciting things. I believe learning to be a lifelong journey that is never complete. If I am the one in the room who knows the most about a given topic I'll find another room.
- 💞️ If I appear to be the one who could contribute meaningfully to a project or I could grow from the experience feel free to reach out! However time and availability varies according to whatever life brings at the moment.
- 📫 You can reach me at nullr0ck@protonmail.com with any questions, comments, concerns, or interesting thoughts and ideas.
